This tutorial is part of the 2024 Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops Beginner Microbiome Analysis (St John's, NL, May 27-28). It is based on the Amplicon SOP v2 available on the [Microbiome Helper repository](https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/Amplicon-SOP-v2-(qiime2-2022.11)) and previous workshops designed by Diana Haider and Robert Beiko.

## Introduction

Modules 2 and 3 provide a walkthrough of an end-to-end pipeline using the command line interface for the analysis of high-throughput marker gene data. Commonly used marker genes for microbiome analysis include the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) for prokaryotes, 18S rRNA for eukaryotes, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi. In this tutorial, we will explore a 16S rRNA dataset from wild blueberry (*Vaccinium angustifolium*) soil communities from both bulk and rhizosphere soils associated with either natural or managed habitats. You can read more about the study in these papers:

-   [Variation in Bacterial and Eukaryotic Communities Associated with Natural and Managed Wild Blueberry Habitats](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PBIOMES-03-17-0012-R)
-   [Metagenomic Functional Shifts to Plant Induced Environmental Changes](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01682/full#B50)

In Module 2 we will cover the basics of marker gene analysis from raw reads to filtered feature table. The pipeline described is embedded in the latest version of QIIME2 (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology version 2024.2), which is a popular microbiome bioinformatics platform for microbial ecology built on user-made software packages called plugins that work on QIIME2 artifact or QZA files. Documentation for these plugins can be found in the [QIIME 2 user documentation](https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.2/), along with tutorials and other useful information. QIIME2 also provides interpretable visualizations that can be accessed by opening any generated QZV files within [QIIME2 View](https://view.qiime2.org/).

Create for Module 2 inside `workspace` and create a symlink to the raw FASTQ files from Module 1 and the metadata file.

```         
cd ~/workspace
mkdir bmb_module2
cd bmb_module2
ln -s ~/CourseData/MIC_data/BMB_data/raw_data/ .
ln -s ~/CourseData/MIC_data/BMB_data/Blueberry_metadata_reduced.tsv .
```

You will have installed the latest version of QIIME2 in Module 1, so you can either activate that environment with the command below or activate our backup QIIME2 environment if you ran into any problems with the installation.

```         
conda activate qiime2-amplicon-2024.2
```

```         
conda activate qiime2-amplicon-backup
```

When you are finished this tutorial you can deactivate the environment using:

```         
conda deactivate
```

Throughout this module, there are some questions aimed to help your understanding of some of the key concepts. You'll find the answers at the bottom of this page, but no one will be marking them.

## 1. First steps

### 1.1. Inspect raw data

First, let's take a look at the directory containing our raw reads as well as our metadata file.

```         
ls raw_data
```

```         
head Blueberry_metadata_reduced.tsv
```

**Question 1: How many samples are there?**

**Question 2: Into what group(s) are the samples classified?**

### 1.2. Import FASTQs as QIIME2 artifact

To standardize QIIME 2 analyses and to keep track of provenance (i.e. a list of what commands were previously run to produce a file) a special format is used for all QIIME 2 input and output files called an "artifact" (with the extension QZA). The first step is to import the raw reads as a QZA file. We will first create a new directory.

```         
mkdir reads_qza
```

```         
qiime tools import \
  --type SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality] \
  --input-path raw_data/ \
  --output-path reads_qza/reads.qza \
  --input-format CasavaOneEightSingleLanePerSampleDirFmt
```

All of the FASTQs are now in the single artifact file reads_qza/reads.qza. This file format can be a little confusing at first, but it is actually just a zipped folder. You can manipulate and explore these files better with the `qiime tools utilities` (e.g. `peek` and `view`).

### 1.3. Trim primers with cutadapt

Screen out reads that do not begin with primer sequence and remove primer sequence from reads using the [cutadapt](http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) QIIME 2 plugin. The below primers correspond to the 16S V6-V8 region (bacteria-specific primer set).

```         
qiime cutadapt trim-paired \
  --i-demultiplexed-sequences reads_qza/reads.qza \
  --p-cores 4 \
  --p-front-f ACGCGHNRAACCTTACC \
  --p-front-r ACGGGCRGTGWGTRCAA \
  --p-discard-untrimmed \
  --p-no-indels \
  --o-trimmed-sequences reads_qza/reads_trimmed.qza
```

Visualizing your output data is a good idea after any step to make sure nothing unexpected occurred. The following command generates a "visualization" file with the extension QZV.

We still have a few preprocessing requirements to check off our list before denoising, so we can wait until these steps are complete to visualize our data. However, if you would like to see what paired-end reads look like before joining, run the following command and open the QZV file in [QIIME2 View](https://view.qiime2.org/).

```         
qiime demux summarize \
  --i-data reads_qza/reads_trimmed.qza \
  --o-visualization reads_qza/reads_trimmed_summary.qzv
```

**Question 3: What would happen if you ran this exact command on V4/V5-amplified sequences?**

## 2. Denoising the reads into amplicon sequence variants

Different denoising tools require different levels of preprocessing before the actual denoising happens. For example, DADA2 performs read joining and quality filtering as part of the denoising step itself, and can be run directly after trimming the primers. Due to speed considerations, we'll be using Deblur instead, which requires that these steps be carried out separately. Guidelines for running DADA2 can be found [here](https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/QIIME2-DADA2-Quick-Reference).

### 2.1. Join paired-end reads

Forward and reverse reads can be joined with [VSEARCH](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) as shown below. This will generate QZA files for both the joined/merged sequences and unmerged sequences.

```         
qiime vsearch merge-pairs \
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs reads_qza/reads_trimmed.qza \
  --output-dir reads_qza/reads_joined
```

### 2.2. Filter out low-quality reads

This command will filter out low-quality reads based on the default options.

```         
qiime quality-filter q-score \
  --i-demux reads_qza/reads_joined/merged_sequences.qza \
  --o-filter-stats filt_stats.qza \
  --o-filtered-sequences reads_qza/reads_trimmed_joined_filt.qza
```

### 2.3. Summarize joined and filtered reads

It is a good idea at this point just to verify that there haven't been any substantial losses of reads, before going through the whole ASV process, at either the joining or quality-filtering steps above. You will also need to select a length to trim back to that maintains the largest/acceptable quantity of reads during denoising.

```         
qiime demux summarize \
  --i-data reads_qza/reads_trimmed_joined_filt.qza \
  --o-visualization reads_qza/reads_trimmed_joined_filt_summary.qzv
```

Now open the file in [QIIME2 View](https://view.qiime2.org/) and look at the Overview and Interactive Quality Plot tabs to explore your data and answer the following questions.

**Question 4: How long are our forward reads? Why are there no reverse reads in our file?**

**Question 5: What would be a good trim length for our reads? Hint: you don't need to overthink this.**

### 2.4. Running Deblur

Running the [Deblur](https://github.com/biocore/deblur) workflow will correct the raw reads into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). This denoising tool filters out reads that either do match to known noise or that do not match with low similarity to the expected amplicon region. Note that the below command will retain singletons, which would have been filtered out unless we set --p-min-reads 1, and is for 16S sequences only. For other amplicon regions, you can either use the denoise-other option in the command and specify a reference database of sequences to use for positive filtering (as in the below versions for 18S and ITS) or use DADA2.

```         
qiime deblur denoise-16S \
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs reads_qza/reads_trimmed_joined_filt.qza \
  --p-trim-length 390 \
  --p-sample-stats \
  --p-jobs-to-start 4 \
  --p-min-reads 1 \
  --output-dir deblur_output
```

*Note: this command may take up to 10 minutes or so to run.*

When running 18S and ITS data with deblur you will need to specify custom reference files, which can be downloaded [here](http://kronos.pharmacology.dal.ca/public_files/MH/deblur_non16S_ref/). Further instructions on denoising 18S and ITS can be found on the [Microbiome Helper repository](https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/Amplicon-SOP-v2-(qiime2-2022.11))

If you started running the deblur command, you can stop it by pressing `ctrl+c`. You can always use this to stop the command that is currently running - this is particularly useful if you accidentally run something using the wrong parameters and the command will take a long time to run.

### 2.5. Summarizing Deblur output

Once a denoising pipeline has been run you can summarize the output table with the below command, which will create a visualization artifact for you to view. We will use this visualization later to determine the the cut-offs for filtering the table below, but for now you should mainly take a look at the visualization to ensure that sufficient reads have been retained after running deblur. This denoising tool filters out reads that either do match to known noise or that do not match with low similarity to the expected amplicon region. If your samples have very low depth after running deblur (compared to the input read depth) this could be a red flag that either you ran the tool incorrectly, you have a lot of noise in your data, or that deblur is inappropriate for your dataset.

```         
qiime feature-table summarize \
  --i-table deblur_output/table.qza \
  --o-visualization deblur_output/deblur_table_summary.qzv
```

**Question 6: What is the mean sequencing depth per sample after denoising?**

**Question 7: Which sample has the least reads?**

## 3. Assign taxonomy to ASVs

You can assign taxonomy to your ASVs using a Naive-Bayes approach implemented in the [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Python library and the [SILVA](https://www.arb-silva.de/) or [UNITE](https://unite.ut.ee/) databases. This approach requires that a classifier be trained in advance on a reference database. We recommend users use a widely used classifier to help ensure there are no unexpected issues with the Naive-Bayes model. We previously maintained primer-specific classifiers, which theoretically can provide more accurate classifications, but we no longer do this due to concerns regarding issues with the trained models that are difficult to catch if only a couple people are running them. The full-length 16S/18S classifier can be downloaded from the [QIIME 2 website](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.11/data-resources/) (silva-138-99-nb-classifier.qza for the latest classifier). Custom classifiers for the ITS region that we have generated from the UNITE database are available as well ([see downloads](http://kronos.pharmacology.dal.ca/public_files/MH/taxa_classifiers/qiime2-2020.8_classifiers) and [commands used to create these files](https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/Creating-QIIME-2-Taxonomic-Classifiers)):

-   Full ITS - fungi only (classifier_sh_refs_qiime_ver9_99_s_27.10.2022_ITS.qza)
-   Full ITS - all eukaryotes (classifier_sh_refs_qiime_ver9_99_s_all_27.10.2022_ITS.qza)

### 3.1. Run taxonomic classification

You can run the taxonomic classification with this command, which is one of the longest running and most memory-intensive command of the tutorial. If you receive an error related to insufficient memory (and if you cannot increase your memory usage) then you can look into the --p-reads-per-batch option and set this to be lower than the default (which is dynamic depending on sample depth and the number of threads) and also try running the command with fewer jobs (e.g. set --p-n-jobs 1).

**Because of the memory constraints of this workshop, you can copy the output into your folder:**

```         
ln -s ~/CourseData/MIC_data/BMB_data/taxa .
```

But here is the code you would use to run the taxonomic classification:

```         
qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \
  --i-reads deblur_output/representative_sequences.qza \
  --i-classifier ~/CourseData/MIC_data/BMB_data/silva-138-99-nb-classifier.qza \
  --p-n-jobs 4 \
  --output-dir taxa
```

### *3.2 (Optional) Assess subset of taxonomic assignments with BLAST*

As with all QZA files, you can export the output file to take a look at the classifications and confidence scores:

```         
qiime tools export \
  --input-path taxa/classification.qza \
  --output-path taxa
```

The performance of the taxonomic classification is difficult to assess without a gold-standard reference, but nonetheless one basic sanity check is to compare the taxonomic assignments with the top BLASTn hits for certain ASVs. First, generate a QZV file for the denoised representative sequences in QIIME 2 by running:

```         
qiime feature-table tabulate-seqs \
  --i-data deblur_output/representative_sequences.qza \
  --o-visualization deblur_output/representative_sequences.qzv
```

This QZV file tabulates the denoised sequences. Clicking on the nucleotide sequence links to a BLASTn search for that sequence. By comparing these BLAST hits with the taxonomic assignment of ASVs generated above you can reassure yourself that the taxonomic assignments overall worked correctly. It's a good idea to select \~5 ASVs to BLAST for this validation, which should be from taxonomically different groups, such as different phyla, according to the taxonomic classifier.

## 4. Filtering resultant table

Filtering the denoised table is an important step of microbiome data analysis. You can see more details on this process in the [QIIME 2 filtering tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.11/tutorials/filtering/).

### 4.1. Filter out rare ASVs

Based on the summary visualization created in step 2.5 above you can choose a cut-off for how frequent a variant needs to be (and optionally how many samples need to have the variant) for it to be retained. Here we will remove all ASVs that have a frequency of less than 0.1% of the mean sample depth. This cut-off excludes ASVs that are likely due to MiSeq bleed-through between runs (reported by Illumina to be 0.1% of reads). To calculate this cut-off you would identify the mean sample depth in the visualization created in step 2.5, multiply it by 0.001, and round to the nearest integer.

Once you've determined how you would like to filter your table you can do so with this command (X is a placeholder for your choice):

```         
qiime feature-table filter-features \
  --i-table deblur_output/table.qza \
  --p-min-frequency X \
  --p-min-samples 1 \
  --o-filtered-table deblur_output/deblur_table_filt.qza
```

### 4.2. Filter out contaminant and unclassified ASVs

Once we have assigned taxonomy to our ASVs we can use that information to remove ASVs which are likely contaminants or noise based on the taxonomic labels. Two common contaminants in 16S sequencing data are mitochondrial and chloroplast 16S sequences, which can be removed by excluding any ASV which contains those terms in its taxonomic label. It can also be **sometimes** useful to exclude any ASV that is unclassified at the phylum level since these sequences could be noise (e.g. possible chimeric sequences). Note that if your data has not been classified against the default database you may need to change p\_\_ to be a string that enables phylum-level assignments to be identified or simply omit that line.

In general though, it can be very informative if your sequencing reads are coming back with significant amounts of unclassified ASVs as it can indicate upstream analysis problems or indicate you are studying a poorly characterized environment where you have a good chance of identifying a lot of novel phyla. Therefore, our recommendation is to not filter out the unclassified sequences by default, but we will do so here.

```         
qiime taxa filter-table \
  --i-table deblur_output/deblur_table_filt.qza \
  --i-taxonomy taxa/classification.qza \
  --p-include p__ \
  --p-exclude mitochondria,chloroplast \
  --o-filtered-table deblur_output/deblur_table_filt_contam.qza
```

### *4.3. (Optional) Exclude low-depth samples*

Often certain samples will have quite low depth after these filtering steps, which can be excluded from downstream analyses since they will largely add noise. There is no single cut-off that works best for all datasets, but researchers often use minimum cut-offs within the range of 1000 to 4000 reads. You can also use a cut-off much lower than this if you want to retain all samples except those that failed entirely (e.g. depth \< 50 reads).

Ideally you would choose this cut-off after visualizing rarefaction curves to determine at what read depth the richness of your samples plateaus and choose a cut-off as close to this plateau as possible while retaining sufficient sample size for your analyses. We learn more about rarefaction curves in Module 3.

### 4.4. Subset and summarize filtered table

Check output after filtering.

```         
qiime feature-table summarize \
  --i-table deblur_output/deblur_table_filt_contam.qza \
  --o-visualization deblur_output/deblur_table_filt_contam_summary.qzv
```

**Question 8: What is the minimum and maximum sequencing depth across all samples?**

Happy? Copy a final table.

```         
cp deblur_output/deblur_table_filt_contam.qza deblur_output/deblur_table_final.qza
```

Once we have our final filtered table we will need to subset the QZA file containing the ASV sequences to the same set. You can exclude any removed ASVs from the sequence file with this command:

```         
qiime feature-table filter-seqs \
  --i-data deblur_output/representative_sequences.qza \
  --i-table deblur_output/deblur_table_final.qza  \
  --o-filtered-data deblur_output/rep_seqs_final.qza
```

Finally, you can make a new summary of the final filtered abundance table:

```         
qiime feature-table summarize \
  --i-table deblur_output/deblur_table_final.qza \
  --o-visualization deblur_output/deblur_table_final_summary.qzv
```

## Answers

**Question 1: How many samples are there?**

We have 12 samples. The raw data folder contains one fastq.gz file for each set of the forward and reverse sequences (labelled R1 and R2, respectively) for each of the samples (BBxxx).

**Question 2: Into what group(s) are the samples classified?**

The samples are classified into two different groups: either bulk or rhizosphere soil and forest or managed sites.

**Question 3: What would happen if you ran this exact command on V4/V5-amplified sequences?**

`Cutadapt` will only trim reads that match the specified primer sequence. Therefore, most reads would be discarded because we are including the `--p-discard-untrimmed` option.

**Question 4: How long are our forward reads? Why are there no reverse reads in our file?**

The forward read median length is 405 nucleotides. There are no reverse reads because forward and reverse reads were merged into one sequence during read joining.

**Question 5: What would be a good cut-off?**

There is no one right answer for this question, but a nice and round trim length of 400 nucleotides is good enough to maintain a proper balance between depth and quality. However, we will use 390 in the actual denoising step because our output files were pre-ran with that length (and using a different cut-off will give us errors down the road).

**Question 6: What is the mean sequencing depth per sample after denoising?**

The mean sequencing depth (frequency) across all denoised samples is 10,777 reads.

**Question 7: Which sample has the least reads?**

Sample BB203 has the lowest sequencing depth (7,397 reads).

**Question 8: What is the maximum sequencing depth across all samples?**

The final maximum sequencing depth is 11,536 reads.
